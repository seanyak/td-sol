## What is MemePin?

**MemePin** represents a unique twist on meme culture backed by **DePin** (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network). Hoskilien merges the playful nature of meme coins with real world utility. Through **World Mobile Nodes**, Hoskilien aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem, redistributing rewards to its treasury and liquidity pool. As the treasury grows, more nodes will be deployed to expand utility and deliver consistent value to the community.
